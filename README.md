We're doing a guessing game with math-related hints, of varying difficulty levels.

For Iteration 1, we're just getting the guessing game itself working, with very simple math hints.
If Professor Shook is reading this, we're doing this Tuesday, 3/29, in the afternoon. A project for another class has held most of us up for the previous week.

For the next iteration, we intend to implement the ability to choose other difficulties, and if we have the time, the other difficulties themselves. (If we're unable to implement the other difficulties, the same kind of hints from the first difficulty will be used.)
