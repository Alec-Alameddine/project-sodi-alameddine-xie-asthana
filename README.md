This is a guessing game with math-related hints, of varying difficulty levels.

For Iteration 1, we're just getting the guessing game itself working, with very simple math hints.

The game will work like this:

You choose your difficulty level. If difficulty is hard, you might get a problem like cos(Ï€/67), and as you guess, you'll be told "warmer" or "colder" relative to the last guess. Conversely, if the difficuly is easy, you might get a problem like 3sqrt(81), with much more revealing hints, such as distance away from the answer
