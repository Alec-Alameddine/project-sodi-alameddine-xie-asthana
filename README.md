This is a guessing game with math-related hints, of varying difficulty levels.

For Iteration 1, we're just getting the guessing game itself working, with very simple math hints.

The game will work like this:
You choose your difficulty level. If difficulty is hard, you might get a problem like cos(Ï€/67), and as you guess, you'll be told "warmer" or "colder" relative to the last guess. Conversely, if the difficuly is easy, you might get a problem like 3sqrt(81), with much more revealing hints, such as distance away from the answer

For the next iteration, we intend to implement the ability to choose other difficulties, and if we have the time, the other difficulties themselves. (If we're unable to implement the other difficulties, the same kind of hints from the first difficulty will be used.)
